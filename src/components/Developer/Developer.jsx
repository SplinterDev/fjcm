      <p>I am a Software Engineer and Web Developer. More specifically, I'm a Fullstack JavaScript developer. I started working on web development in 2009 and, since then, I've done back end with PHP, Python, and NodeJS, and front end with Bootstrap, jQuery, React, and Angular. I'm not mentioning HTML, CSS, and JS because, well, that's the default. And I probably forgot a bunch of stuff I've worked with, but you get the picture. Currently, my favorite stack is Express and React, but I also work with Angular.</p>
      <p>Other than that, I'm a <del>mad</del> scientist, a computer one. In 2019, I got a Master's Degree in Computer Science, where I studied Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: I secretly only got a Master's Degree because my online nickname is Splinter, and I wanted to be called "Master Splinter." Depending on your age, this joke may have gone over your head -- I'm sorry.</p>
      <p>You can peek at my <del>unfinished</del> projects on <a href="https://github.com/SplinterDev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> and get in touch with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabricio-jc-montenegro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
