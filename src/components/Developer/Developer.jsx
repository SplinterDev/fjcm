      <p>I am a Software Engineer and Web Developer. More specifically, I'm a Fullstack JavaScript developer. I started working on web development in 2009 and I have used anything from PHP to Java to Python in the back end. Currently, my favorite stack is ExpressJS and ReactJS, but I also work with Angular.</p>
      <p>I'm also a <del>mad</del> scientist, a computer one. In 2019, I got a Master's Degree in Computer Science, where I studied Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: I secretly only got a Master's Degree because my online nickname is Splinter and I wanted to be called "Master Splinter." Depending on your age, this joke may have gone over your head -- I'm sorry.</p>
      <p>You can take a look at my <del>unfinished</del> projects on <a href="https://github.com/SplinterDev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> or get in touch with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabricio-jc-montenegro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
