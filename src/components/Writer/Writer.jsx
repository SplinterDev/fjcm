      <p>Although I'm Brazilian, I enjoy reading and writing fiction in English. You can check my stories on <a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/creative-writing-prompts/author/splinter-magus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reedsy Prompts</a>, where my story <a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/creative-writing-prompts/contests/68/submissions/43670/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Silence</a> has been picked as the winner among over a thousand submissions on contest #68 (I will talk about this on every opportunity I get).</p>
      <p>I also sometimes post on <a href="https://fjcm.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a>, so if you like irregularly scheduled content, give it a follow. I follow no schedule whatsoever. You're gonna love it.</p>
      <p>If you want to get in touch and discuss what is the most compelling end-of-world scenario, you can add me on Discord (SplinterFM#6322) and we can throw some theories around. Also, if you're inclined, I can read your fiction for free and give you my humble opinion (be aware: I'm a slow reader).</p>
