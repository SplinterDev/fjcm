More specifically, I'm a Fullstack JavaScript developer. I started working on web development in 2009 and, since then, I've done back end with PHP, Python, and NodeJS, and front end with Bootstrap, jQuery, React, and Angular. I'm not mentioning HTML, CSS, and JS because, well, that's the default. And I probably forgot a bunch of stuff I've worked with, but you get the picture. Currently, my favorite stack is Express and React, but I also work with Angular.</p>\r\n      <p>Other than that, I'm a <del>mad</del> scientist, a computer one.
